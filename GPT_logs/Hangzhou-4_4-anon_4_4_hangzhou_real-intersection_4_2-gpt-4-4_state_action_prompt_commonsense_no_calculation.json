You can use your knowledge of traffic commonsense to solve traffic signal control tasks."}, {"role": "user", "content": "A crossroad connects two roads: the north-south and east-west. The traffic light is located at the intersection of the two roads. The north-south road is divided into two sections by the intersection: the north and south. Similarly, the east-west road is divided into the east and west. Each section has two lanes: a through and a left-turn lane. Each lane is further divided into three segments. Segment 1 is the closest to the intersection. Segment 2 is in the middle. Segment 3 is the farthest. In a lane, there may be early queued vehicles and approaching vehicles traveling in different segments. Early queued vehicles have arrived at the intersection and await passage permission. Approaching vehicles will arrive at the intersection in the future.\n\nThe traffic light has 4 signal phases. Each signal relieves vehicles' flow in the group of two specific lanes.

Each signal allows vehicles in two specific lanes to proceed. The key metric for evaluating traffic congestion is the number of **early queued vehicles**, as they are already at the intersection and waiting for the signal to turn green. These vehicles have the most immediate impact on congestion and delay. Vehicles in distant segments (Segment 3) are not urgent since they are far from the intersection and will take time to arrive.\n\nLet\u2019s examine each signal phase:\n\n- **ETWT (Eastern and Western Through Lanes)**:\n  - Early queued: 0 (East), 0 (West) \u2192 Total = 0\n  - Segment 1: 0, Segment 2: 0, Segment 3: 1 (East only)\n  - \u2192 No vehicles waiting at the intersection. Only 1 vehicle in Segment 3 (East), which is far away and will not arrive soon. **No immediate congestion to relieve.**\n\n- **NTST (Northern and Southern Through Lanes)**:\n  - Early queued: 0 (North), 0 (South) \u2192 Total = 0\n  - All segments: 0 vehicles\n  - \u2192 **No vehicles at all** in these lanes. No congestion to address.\n\n- **ELWL (Eastern and Western Left-Turn Lanes)**:\n  - Early queued: 0 (East), 0 (West) \u2192 Total = 0\n  - All segments: 0 vehicles\n  - \u2192 **No vehicles present** in these lanes. No congestion.\n\n- **NLSL (Northern and Southern Left-Turn Lanes)**:\n  - Early queued: 0 (North), 0 (South) \u2192 Total = 0\n  - All segments: 0 vehicles\n  - \u2192 **No vehicles present** in these lanes. No congestion.\n\n**Conclusion from analysis**:\nAll four signal phases currently have **zero early queued vehicles**. The only vehicle present is in Segment 3 of the East through lane under ETWT, which is not urgent. Since congestion is primarily dictated by early queued vehicles, and there are none in any lane, **no signal phase will significantly improve traffic conditions right now**.\n\nHowever, the question asks: *\u201cWhich is the most effective traffic signal that will most significantly improve the traffic condition during the next phase?\u201d*\n\nEven though there are no early queued vehicles, we must choose **one** signal. Since the only vehicle present is in the East through lane (Segment 3), and it will eventually reach the intersection, the **ETWT** signal is the only one that will allow that vehicle to proceed once it arrives. The other signals have no vehicles at all.\n\nTherefore, **ETWT** is the only signal that will have any future impact, as it will allow the approaching vehicle (in Segment 3) to eventually clear the intersection. The other signals will have no effect because there are no vehicles in their allowed lanes.\n\nStep 2: Answer your chosen signal.\n\n<signal>ETWT</signal>"}], "action": "ETWT"}]
